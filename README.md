# MOUSE-MAZE

Mouse-Maze is a small game built in 4-5 days during a 2month long coding bootcamp with the Ironhack coding school. It was the first project of the bootcamp. Its currently not running, because its under reconstruction.

The purpose of the game is to get you computer pointer (Pointy) through the maze. But be careful, the walls are cursed with the social-life depraving Iron-curse, so don't go touching those. As You progress the levels get harder to complete, and you meet new challenges. 

Try it! But be careful! Theres no guarantee that you and Pointy will be able to escape the cursed creatures that still dwell under the surface of THE MOUSE MAZE!!
